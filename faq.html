            <strong>Q: Why did you make this site?</strong><br /> A: This project was created as part of a school assignment to practice <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and a touch of <strong>JavaScript</strong>.<br /> But instead of going with a generic portfolio or static resume, I thoughtâ€”why not have fun with it? So I turned it into a tribute to some of the games that left an impression on me.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Q: Are these your favorite games?</strong><br /> A: <strong>Some of them, absolutely!</strong> They all mean something different to meâ€”whether itâ€™s the mystery of <em>Outer Wilds</em>, the absurd genius of <em>Disco Elysium</em>, or the structured chaos of <em>Satisfactory</em>.<br /> Each game let me play with different visual styles, layouts, and writing tones, so I could stretch my creative and coding muscles a bit more.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Q: Is everything built from scratch?</strong><br /> A: Yep! No frameworks, just a few templates (lightbox and ToS popup which is a modal). Otherwise just <strong>good old-fashioned hand-coded HTML & CSS</strong>, with some JavaScript sprinkled in to handle interactivity like the image lightboxes.<br /> This whole thing has been a great way to learn responsive design, custom layouts, and how to make things weird on purpose.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Q: Whatâ€™s with all the weird references?</strong><br /> A: Itâ€™s a part of my personality. I like things that are a little surreal, a little unexpected.<br /> Plus, if you can make someone laugh or pause for a second, theyâ€™re more likely to remember your work.
            <br /><br />

            <strong>Q: Who are you?</strong><br /> A: My nameâ€™s Adam, Iâ€™m 37, and Iâ€™ve recently taken the plunge into <strong>web development</strong>.<br /> I come from a tech background but decided to shift gears and dive headfirst into the front-end world. This site is a snapshot of that journey so far.

            <br /><br />

            <strong>Q: Are you planning to keep working on this?</strong><br /> A: Possibly! I might expand it with more games, animations, or rewrite it using a JS framework once Iâ€™ve learned one properly.<br /> Right now, the focus was getting a solid, creative project out the door using just the basics.

            <br /><br />

            <strong>Q: Why isnâ€™t there a dark mode toggle?</strong><br /> A: Because itâ€™s already dark enoughâ€”emotionally and stylistically. ðŸ˜Ž

            <br /><br />

            <strong>Q: Whatâ€™s the biggest thing you learned during this project?</strong><br /> A: How <strong>layout and structure</strong> affect everything. Itâ€™s one thing to style somethingâ€”itâ€™s another to design with intent, responsiveness, and accessibility in mind.<br /> Also: never underestimate how much fun you can have with <flexbox> and a few good fonts.

            <br /><br />

            <strong>Q: And... the horse?</strong><br /> A: The horse chose me. It is now part of the brand.<br /> Let us never speak of this again.
