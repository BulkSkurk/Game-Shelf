            Hello there! My name is Adam, I’m 37 years old and currently exploring the world of web
            development. <br />
            This site is a little reflection of me—my interests, my taste in games, and my sense of
            humor. <br />
            I’ve got a background in tech, but now I’m diving headfirst into HTML, CSS, and a pinch
            of JavaScript. <br />
            You’ll find I like things weird, clever, and just a little bit chaotic—whether it’s in
            code or in the games I play.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="other-right">
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I'm passionate about storytelling, martial arts, and anything that
            sparks curiosity. <br />
            I’ve always loved diving into fictional worlds, whether it’s through games, books, or a
            beautifully crafted film. <br />
            I enjoy working on creative projects, and I love games that make you think in new
            ways—like Outer Wilds and Disco Elysium. <br />
            I also have a soft spot for humor that’s just a little bit absurd, and stories that
            aren’t afraid to get weird or philosophical. <br />
            These things inspire the way I approach design and development too—I want what I create
            to have character, to make you smile, or at least make you curious. <br />
            This page isn’t just about practicing markup—it’s about showcasing what I love, in a
            format that’s fun to build. <br />
            Also, I strongly believe every good site should have at least one cryptic horse head
            photo. Don’t question it. Embrace it. <br />
            That photo? That’s me, at my most majestic. A symbol of chaos, curiosity, and the
            occasional CSS bug. <br />
            This whole site has been my playground, and I'm learning more every day. Still lots to
            do—but hey, that's half the fun.
          </p>

          This project was created for a school assignment, where the goal is to learn and
          demonstrate basic front-end skills—HTML, CSS, and just a little bit of JavaScript. <br />
          Instead of a generic portfolio, I wanted to make something personal. <br />
          The idea to theme it around my favorite games came naturally: they’re stories I’ve
          experienced, and worlds I admire. <br />
          Each section is a chance to practice layout, design, responsiveness, and a bit of
          personality. <br />
          Everything’s been built from scratch—minimal boilerplate, no frameworks—just good
          old-fashioned code and a lot of experimenting. <br />
          Hope you enjoy it!
