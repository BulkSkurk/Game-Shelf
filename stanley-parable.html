        <p>
          Disco Elysium is a role-playing game unlike anything else. It begins with a man waking up
          on the floor of a trashed hostel room, his memory obliterated, his body in shambles, and
          his internal monologue screaming. He has no idea who he is, what he’s done, or why there’s
          a dead man hanging behind the building.
          <br /><br />
          You are that man—a detective, barely functional, physically and mentally ruined. And yet,
          you have a job to do. You must investigate the murder, navigate the ruins of your
          fractured identity, and confront the broken city around you. All of this unfolds in the
          war-torn coastal district of Martinaise, a place soaked in post-revolution
          disillusionment, where flags of failed ideologies still hang limp in the cold breeze.
          <br /><br />
          What makes Disco Elysium so singular isn’t just the premise—it’s how it lets you engage
          with it. Instead of traditional RPG combat, the game is built around conversation,
          introspection, and thought. Your mind is a battlefield. Dozens of skills, each personified
          as characters inside your head, argue and whisper and shout over each other as you try to
          make sense of the world. Empathy might urge you to comfort a crying child.
          Electrochemistry might push you to score speed behind a convenience store. Logic might
          tell you to keep quiet, while Drama encourages you to lie spectacularly. <br /><br />
          You aren’t building a character—you are unearthing one. Every decision you make shapes who
          this detective becomes. Will you chase redemption, or spiral further into
          self-destruction? Will you uncover the truth, or cling to comforting lies? Will you
          embrace ideology, reject it, parody it, or become its vessel? The game never forces a
          direction. It simply lets you fall—or rise—as you will. <br /><br />
          The city of Revachol is more than a backdrop. It’s a living, bleeding character. A place
          soaked in history, pain, and poetry. The people who live there—from union bosses to
          working-class mothers to cryptozoologists and teenage punks—are all navigating the
          aftermath of a world that promised change but delivered collapse. Every conversation you
          have, every place you visit, deepens the sense that this is not a world built for heroes.
          It’s a world that keeps moving whether you show up or not. <br /><br />
          And yet, Disco Elysium is often hilarious. It’s absurd, surreal, and full of strange
          beauty. It allows for moments of tenderness, quiet melancholy, and poetic madness. One
          minute you’re debating dialectical materialism with your subconscious, the next you’re
          having an emotional breakdown over your tie. Somehow, it all fits. Somehow, it all
          matters. <br /><br />
          The art direction is stunning—painterly and expressive, like a political cartoon sketched
          over oil on canvas. The soundtrack, composed by British Sea Power, is ethereal, mournful,
          and strangely triumphant. It pulses through scenes like a heartbeat beneath the
          narrative’s skin. <br /><br />
          Disco Elysium doesn’t ask you to save the world. It doesn’t even ask you to solve the case
          particularly well. It simply asks: who are you? And how do you live with the answer?
          <br /><br />
          It is a game that trusts you to think, to reflect, and to listen—not just to others, but
          to yourself. There’s no easy resolution, no ultimate reward, no perfect ending. But there
          is meaning, if you’re willing to dig deep enough to find it. <br /><br />
          Few games aim this high. Fewer still actually reach it. Disco Elysium does, and it doesn’t
          even break a sweat.

          <strong>⚠️ SPOILER WARNING ⚠️</strong>
          The following section contains detailed story spoilers for Disco Elysium. If you haven’t
          finished the game, this will absolutely ruin some of its most powerful revelations.
          Proceed only if you're ready to remember what you’ve forgotten.
          <br /><br />
          You wake up in a cheap hostel room in Martinaise, Revachol, after what appears to be one
          of the worst hangovers in human history. You don’t know your name. You don’t know what
          city you’re in. You don’t know what you’ve done. Your necktie is trying to kill you, your
          reflection fills you with existential horror, and your body feels like it was dropped from
          a great height. A voice in your head tells you you've done something irreversible.
          <br /><br />
          Then someone knocks on the door. A man in a neat blue jacket introduces himself as
          Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi. He tells you you’re a police officer. There’s a body hanging
          from a tree behind the building—has been for a week now—and you were supposed to
          investigate it. The investigation hasn’t started. Your badge and gun are missing. You
          don’t remember where you live. Or why you're here. Or who you even are. <br /><br />
          And so begins your journey—not just to solve a murder, but to reconstruct a broken self.
          As you follow leads, interview suspects, and uncover layers of corruption and revolution,
          you slowly begin to piece together your identity. Your name is Harrier Du Bois, and you're
          not just a detective—you’re the detective. Or you were, once. You were brilliant,
          passionate, maybe even heroic. But somewhere along the way, you broke. Something inside
          you cracked under the weight of the past. <br /><br />
          The case takes you through the ruins of a post-revolution city still licking its wounds.
          You meet union men, strike leaders, drug dealers, ideologues, artists, children with too
          much knowledge and too little guidance. You see remnants of failed dreams, unfinished
          revolutions, and memories no one wants to remember. You encounter the Pale—a metaphysical,
          reality-eroding phenomenon that looms just outside the margins of the known world. And
          through it all, you are haunted by the shadow of a woman you can’t quite remember, but
          whose absence is burning a hole in your soul. <br /><br />
          Eventually, you learn that the man in the tree—an ex-mercenary named Lely—was killed not
          as part of a grand political conspiracy, but in a moment of chaotic personal vengeance. A
          drunk, impulsive act. The killer? A washed-up revolutionary hiding in the ruins of the
          doomed revolution, rotting with the past. He fired the shot from an abandoned island, and
          he’s been alone with his memories ever since. <br /><br />
          You confront him, and in doing so, you confront the city itself. You confront the weight
          of history, the futility of ideology, the slow collapse of a world that never lived up to
          its promises. And just when you think you've seen it all—when you've uncovered every lead,
          explored every psyche, and come to terms with your own brokenness—you see it. The phasmid.
          A creature of myth, a massive stick insect long believed to be imaginary, steps out of the
          reeds and speaks to you through empathic resonance. And it tells you that perhaps you're
          not beyond redemption. <br /><br />
          In the end, you don’t get the girl back. You don’t get your old self back. But maybe
          that’s okay. You finish the case. You stand up straight. You walk with Kim back to the
          station, battered, changed, and—just maybe—healing. <br /><br />
          Disco Elysium doesn’t end with a bang. It ends with a deep, heavy exhale. A breath after a
          lifetime of holding it in. It’s not about saving the world—it’s about facing it. And
          choosing to keep going anyway.

      </div>
      <div id="why" class="main-content centered">
        <p>
          Why do I love Disco Elysium? Because it’s absolutely unhinged—in the smartest, sharpest,
          most deliberate way possible. It’s a game that throws you headfirst into a world where
          your brain argues with itself, your thoughts have skill trees, and the line between
          brilliant philosophy and total nonsense is paper-thin. And somehow, it works. It more than
          works. It sings.
          <br /><br />
          What makes Disco Elysium so unforgettable for me is its humor—specifically, how it refuses
          to take anything too seriously, including itself. The writing is absurd, shocking, and
          brutally funny. It doesn’t matter where you land on the ideological spectrum—this game
          will tear it apart, point out the flaws, exaggerate them to cartoonish proportions, and
          then somehow make it meaningful again. You can be a sorry cop, a communist cop, a racist
          cop, a superstar cop, or a disaster of all of the above. Whatever you choose, the game
          commits to it. And then it laughs at you, and with you, all at once. <br /><br />
          The story itself is impossible to predict. Just when you think you understand where it’s
          going, it swerves into strange new territory. There’s no formula here, no hero’s journey
          template. It unfolds organically, shaped by your decisions, your failures, and your
          willingness to go deeper. And what makes that so powerful is how often you’re rewarded not
          for winning, but for understanding. Even the dead ends, the breakdowns, the embarrassing
          choices—they all reveal something real. <br /><br />
          The characters are another reason I keep thinking about this game long after the credits
          rolled. Every single person in Revachol feels layered and alive. Kim Kitsuragi, your
          partner, is one of the best-written and most quietly profound characters I’ve ever
          encountered in a game. But it’s not just him. It’s Cuno, the feral child with a twisted
          mouth and a backstory you don’t see coming. It’s Evrart Claire, the manipulative union
          boss who’s somehow both despicable and weirdly sincere. It’s Joyce Messier, the
          intellectual capitalist with a worldview that’s horrifyingly rational. It’s Measurehead, a
          menacing mountain of supremacist philosophy and taut muscle—both terrifying and strangely
          pitiful, a man clinging to a worldview he barely understands. And, somehow, it’s also your
          tie—The Horrific Necktie—a shrieking, flamboyant voice of chaos that may or may not be
          alive, but definitely has opinions. These aren’t NPCs—they’re people. And talking to them
          changes you. <br /><br />
          There are no clear good guys or bad guys in Disco Elysium. Just people doing their best,
          or their worst, in a world that forgot how to care. Every choice you make has weight, not
          because it affects the plot, but because it makes you reflect. This game lives in the
          moral greyzones—in questions without answers, in systems without justice, in broken people
          trying to find meaning in a place that’s given up on the idea. <br /><br />
          And then there’s the world itself. Revachol is one of the most compelling, fully realized
          settings I’ve ever seen. Every wall has history. Every conversation reveals another scar.
          The city feels like it’s mourning something no one can name, and it pulls you in with the
          quiet, aching gravity of a dream you’re not sure is yours. The lore is dense, strange,
          political, and deeply personal—and it’s all there if you’re willing to dig. <br /><br />
          That’s why I love Disco Elysium. It’s not just that it’s clever or well-written—it’s that
          it trusts you to meet it on its level. It gives you the freedom to fail, to laugh, to
          reflect, and to get completely lost in your own mind. It doesn’t hold your hand. It hands
          you a drink, a thought, a smoldering cigarette, and says, “Well? What are you going to do
          with all this?”

        <p>
          Disco Elysium is not just a game—it’s an intellectual, emotional, and absurdist trip
          through the wreckage of ideology, identity, and failure. It’s a miracle of writing,
          design, and tone management that somehow blends comedy, tragedy, and genuine philosophy
          into a game where your tie screams at you and your subconscious holds parliamentary
          debates about your self-worth.
          <br /><br />
          Let’s start with the score: 9/10. It’s not perfect—but what it does, it does so uniquely
          well that the flaws are just part of its charm. It’s a one-of-a-kind work of interactive
          storytelling that takes enormous risks, and sticks the landing in almost every direction.
          <br /><br />
          Graphics: 7/10. Disco Elysium isn’t trying to impress you with technical fidelity. The
          visuals are painterly, loose, and impressionistic—like the world is being remembered
          through fogged glass or half-faded memory. While it may lack the crisp realism of high-end
          RPGs, it oozes atmosphere. The environments feel dreamlike and layered, colored with
          regret and decay. It’s not flashy, but it is memorable. Every place has a mood, and that
          mood seeps into your choices. <br /><br />
          Story: 10/10. This is where the game becomes something else entirely. The story isn’t just
          a murder mystery—it’s a slow, spiraling journey into the heart of a city, a man, and a
          world trying to remember why it was worth saving. It’s unpredictable, full of sharp turns
          and deep reflection. It takes on political theory, philosophy, post-trauma psychology, and
          still makes room for slapstick and surrealism. And despite all the cynicism, it finds
          something meaningful in the wreckage. The ending doesn’t give you closure—it gives you
          something more honest: a sense that moving forward is possible, even if nothing gets
          fixed. <br /><br />
          Gameplay: 6/10. There’s no combat, no crafting, no looting—just conversations, choices,
          and the constant tug-of-war between the voices in your head. Your stats are personalities.
          Your skills argue with you. And the game lets you build the detective you want to
          be—whether that’s a genius, a clown, a wreck, a revolutionary, or a strange cocktail of
          all four. It’s one of the few games where “failing” skill checks doesn’t end your
          progress—it just opens a different path. The only reason it doesn’t get a full 10 is the
          occasional clunky interface moment or bug. But honestly? Those hiccups barely register
          against the richness of the experience. <br /><br />
          The worldbuilding deserves its own category. Revachol isn’t just a setting—it’s a history
          book written in graffiti, broken flags, and half-finished thoughts. The lore is dense but
          elegant, layered with real emotion and biting critique. You can spend hours just
          talking—to people, to buildings, to yourself—and you’ll come away feeling like you’ve
          learned something. Maybe not something useful. But something true. <br /><br />
          And the soundtrack—oh, the soundtrack. Composed by British Sea Power, it’s haunting,
          aching, defiant. It’s melancholy dressed in elegance. It drifts in and out exactly when it
          needs to, lifting you in quiet moments or breaking your heart when you finally remember
          who you are. It’s a companion just as much as Kim. <br /><br />
          What makes Disco Elysium special, more than anything, is that it lets you be a mess. It
          doesn’t ask you to save the world. It just asks you to survive it, understand it, and
          maybe find some meaning in the chaos. And it gives you the freedom to try—even if you fail
          spectacularly. <br /><br />
          This is a game that challenges how we think about role-playing. About narrative. About
          games as a medium for exploring identity, systems, and absurdity. It’s not for
          everyone—but for those who click with it, it’s unforgettable. <br /><br />
          Final verdict: bold, broken, brilliant. The kind of game that will sit in the back of your
          head for years, whispering strange, beautiful thoughts. <br /><br />
          <strong>Score: 9/10.</strong>
